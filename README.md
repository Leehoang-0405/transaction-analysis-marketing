## ℹ️ Overview  
This project is part of my **MIS784 – Marketing Analytics** coursework at Deakin University.  
The goal was to analyse SmartStream’s customer and transaction data to uncover patterns in buying behaviour, identify the most valuable customer segments, and provide recommendations to improve engagement and sales.

### Key Features:  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Processed customer and transaction datasets for accurate analysis.

- **High-Value Customers**: Top spenders often used the chatbot or engaged across multiple channels.  
- **Lapsed Buyers**: A large customer group showed low recent activity but potential for reactivation.  
- **Channel Insights**: Real-time engagement channels (chatbot, social media) correlated with higher spend.

## 💡 Recommendations  

### 1. Re-engage Lapsed Buyers  
The RFM segmentation revealed a large group of Lapsed Buyers who have not made recent purchases and spend significantly less than the other segments. Re-engaging this group with tailored messages that promote relevant smart home products could help bring them back and recover revenue from previously active customers.  

### 2. Improve Chatbot Functionality  
There is a connection between chatbot usage and customer spending. Customers who use the chatbot more often tend to spend more overall. SmartStream should encourage greater usage by improving the chatbot’s functionality, training it to make it more useful and flexible in answering a wide range of customer questions, and placing it on key pages such as product listings, product details, and the checkout screen.
